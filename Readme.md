# GripMock
GripMock is a **mock server** for **GRPC** services. It's using a `.proto` file to generate implementation of gRPC service for you.
You can use gripmock for setting up end-to-end testing or as a dummy server in a software development phase.
The server implementation is in GoLang but the client can be any programming language that support gRPC.

---

**This is a fork of the
[original Gripmock upstream](https://github.com/tokopedia/gripmock/)**
with the following changes:

Features:

* Support proto3 "optional"

* Support overriding the default server template using a `-template-dir` option
  to provide an alternate directory for the `server.tmpl` and `go_mod.tmpl`
  files.

* Read OpenTelemetry trace metadata in W3C trace context or Zipkin b3 (single
  or multi) formats and emit trace spans to a trace collector if appropriate env-vars
  are set;
  See [Tracing requests and responses with OpenTelemetry](tracing-requests-and-responses-with-opentelemetry)

* Stubs print the services and methods they expose when they start up. This
  should probably be made optional via a log-level control at some point.

Deprecated code replacement:

* Replace use of [`markbates/pkger`](https://github.com/markbates/pkger)
  with native `go:embed` use.

* Replace deprecated `https://github.com/google/protobuf` with
  `google.golang.org/protobuf` and adapt plugin interface accordingly.

* Update to go 1.19

* Pass plugin options as separate generator options, not embedded into input
  file name as comma separated files

Cleanups:

* Remove use of a shell script for munging the protocol files. The `gripmock`
  binary does the required proto source transformations directly, and
  `fix_gopackage.sh` has been deleted.

* Simplify logic for generating output protocol go packages. Instead of trying
  to infer an appropriate package based on working directory, input path prefix
  and import paths, generate sequential go package names like `proto<n>` for
  each protocol.

* Generate a `go.mod` along with the server stub `server.go`, and build the
  server with `go build` instead of using a direct `go run`. This makes it
  easier to ensure that expected modules and versions are present, override
  modules, etc.

* Use a module name for generated code that is not under the gripmock github
  repo. This ensures that the build will use generated protocols. If they're
  not found locally then attempts to download them from the Internet will fail
  visibly.

* Cache build dependencies for the generated servers in the `Dockerfile`
  so that most runs of the container image don't need to make any network
  requests.

* Move gripmock into a subdir so the components don't share a module

* Do not write inside `$GOPATH`; build clean and self contained server stubs
  where the `/go` path is read-only

* Only copy needed files into the docker image; omit tempfiles, go build caches
  etc from the final image

* Use Docker Buildkit cache for image builds when available so that repeat
  builds on one machine are faster and don't repeat downloads even if the
  dockerfile layer cache is invalidated

## Quick Usage

First, prepare your `.proto` file. Or you can use `hello.proto` in
`example/simple/` folder.

It is recommended that you use the gripmock docker container image, as it's
significantly easier to run. This fork doesn't currently publish a pre-built
image, but it's trivial to build one:

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

- Clone this repo: 

      git clone github.com/ringerc/gripmock

- Build the image:

      cd gripmock && docker buildx build -t gripmock .

- Run the `gripmock` image with your protocol files bind-mounted into the
  container by fully qualified path, and with ports exposed for access. We'll
  use the `example/simple.proto` protocol from the gripmock repo, specified by
  full path:

      docker run \
        -p 4770:4770 -p 4771:4771 \
        -v ${PWD}/example/simple:/proto \
	gripmock \
	/proto/simple.proto

- On a separate terminal add a stub into the stub service. Run:

      curl -X POST -d '{
      	"service":"Gripmock",
	"method":"SayHello",
	"input":{
	  "equals":{"name":"gripmock"}
	},
	"output":{
	  "data":{"message":"Hello GripMock"}
	}
      }' \
      localhost:4771/add

  You'll usually want to use stub files instead, but this is handy for a demo.

- Now we are ready to test it. The simplest way is to install
  [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) then call the endpoint
  with:

      grpcurl -plaintext -format json -d '{"name":"gripmock"}' \
	localhost:4770 simple.Gripmock/SayHello

Check [`example`](https://github.com/ringerc/gripmock/tree/master/example)
folder for various usecase of gripmock (all from the original project) and
some example clients.

## How It Works
![Running Gripmock](/assets/images/gripmock_readme-running%20system.png)

From client perspective, GripMock has 2 main components:
1. GRPC server that serves on `tcp://localhost:4770`. Its main job is to serve incoming rpc call from client and then parse the input so that it can be posted to Stub service to find the perfect stub match.
2. Stub server that serves on `http://localhost:4771`. Its main job is to store all the stub mapping. We can add a new stub or list existing stub using http request.

Matched stub will be returned to GRPC service then further parse it to response the rpc call.


From technical perspective, GripMock consists of 2 binaries. 
The first binary is the gripmock itself, when it will generate the gRPC server using the plugin installed in the system (see [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)). 
When the server sucessfully generated, it will be invoked in parallel with stub server which ends up opening 2 ports for client to use.

The second binary is the protoc plugin which located in folder [protoc-gen-gripmock](/protoc-gen-gripmock). This plugin is the one who translates protobuf declaration into a gRPC server in Go programming language. 

![Inside GripMock](/assets/images/gripmock_readme-inside.png)

## Local install

To install and run `gripmock` locally, without using the container image, you will require `protoc-gen-go` and `protoc-gen-go-grpc`:

```bash
go install -v google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest && \
go install -v google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
```

Then in the `gripmock` dir, install both `gripmock` and its protogen plugin:

```bash
(cd gripmock && go install .)
(cd protoc-gen-gripmock && go install .)
```

## Stubbing

Stubbing is the essential mocking of GripMock. It will match and return the expected result into GRPC service. This is where you put all your request expectation and response

### Dynamic stubbing
You could add stubbing on the fly with a simple REST API. HTTP stub server is running on port `:4771`

- `GET /` Will list all stubs mapping.
- `POST /add` Will add stub with provided stub data
- `POST /find` Find matching stub with provided input. see [Input Matching](#input_matching) below.
- `GET /clear` Clear stub mappings.

Stub Format is JSON text format. It has a skeleton as follows:
```
{
  "service":"<servicename>", // name of service defined in proto
  "method":"<methodname>", // name of method that we want to mock
  "input":{ // input matching rule. see Input Matching Rule section below
    // put rule here
  },
  "output":{ // output json if input were matched
    "data":{
      // put result fields here
    },
    "error":"<error message>" // Optional. if you want to return error instead.
  }
}
```

For our `hello` service example we put a stub with the text below:
```
  {
    "service":"Greeter",
    "method":"SayHello",
    "input":{
      "equals":{
        "name":"gripmock"
      }
    },
    "output":{
      "data":{
        "message":"Hello GripMock"
      }
    }
  }
```

### Static stubbing
You could initialize gripmock with stub json files and provide the path using `--stub` argument. For example you may
mount your stub file in `/mystubs` folder then mount it to docker like

`docker run -p 4770:4770 -p 4771:4771 -v /mypath:/proto -v /mystubs:/stub tkpd/gripmock --stub=/stub /proto/hello.proto`

Please note that Gripmock still serves http stubbing to modify stored stubs on the fly.

## <a name="input_matching"></a>Input Matching
Stub will respond with the expected response only if the request matches any rule. Stub service will serve `/find` endpoint with format:
```
{
  "service":"<service name>",
  "method":"<method name>",
  "data":{
    // input that suppose to match with stored stubs
  }
}
```
So if you do a `curl -X POST -d '{"service":"Greeter","method":"SayHello","data":{"name":"gripmock"}}' localhost:4771/find` stub service will find a match from listed stubs stored there.

### Input Matching Rule
Input matching has 3 rules to match an input: **equals**,**contains** and **regex**
<br>
Nested fields are allowed for input matching too for all JSON data types. (`string`, `bool`, `array`, etc.)
<br>
**Gripmock** recursively goes over the fields and tries to match with given input.
<br>
**equals** will match the exact field name and value of input into expected stub. example stub JSON:
```
{
  .
  .
  "input":{
    "equals":{
      "name":"gripmock",
      "greetings": {
            "english": "Hello World!",
            "indonesian": "Halo Dunia!",
            "turkish": "Merhaba DÃ¼nya!"
      },
      "ok": true,
      "numbers": [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
      "null": null
    }
  }
  .
  .
}
```

**contains** will match input that has the value declared expected fields. example stub JSON:
```
{
  .
  .
  "input":{
    "contains":{
      "field2":"hello",
      "field4":{
        "field5": "value5"
      } 
    }
  }
  .
  .
}
```

**matches** using regex for matching fields expectation. example:

```
{
  .
  .
  "input":{
    "matches":{
      "name":"^grip.*$",
      "cities": ["Jakarta", "Istanbul", ".*grad$"]
    }
  }
  .
  .
}
```

## Discovering methods

The server stubs print the methods they expose on startup, but the gripmock
server exposes a reflection interface so you can also use
[grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) to list them with e.g.:

    grpcurl -plaintext localhost:5880 list

## Tracing requests and responses with OpenTelemetry

Gripmock generates an OpenTelemetry-enabled gRPC server that will send trace
events to the OpenTelemetry collector, a zipkin server, or write them as json
to stdout.

Simple example:

    OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=stdout gripmock

### Available trace exporters

To enable tracing, set the env-var `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` to a comma-separated list
of one or more of `otlp`, `zipkin` and `stdout`

#### OpenTelemetry exporter

`OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp` will send traces to an [OpenTelemetry collector endpoint](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/exporter.md#configuration-options) at `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` in format `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_PROTOCOL`.

For a HTTP exporter endpoint:

    OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL="http/protobuf" OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318 gripmock ...

For a gRPC exporter endpoint:

    OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL="grpc" OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317 gripmock ...

Optionally `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE=true` may be set to disable the use of
TLS for trace event delivery. See [the spec](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/exporter.md) for certificate configuration and other options.

#### Zipkin exporter

`OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=zipkin` will send traces to Zipkin-compatible server at [`OTEL_EXPORTER_ZIPKIN_ENDPOINT`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/sdk-environment-variables/#zipkin-exporter), e.g.:

    OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=zipkin OTEL_EXPORTER_ZIPKIN_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans gripmock ...

#### stdout exporter

`OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=stdout` will write json trace events to stdout.

Unlike the other exporters, the stdout writer is configured to be *synchonous*,
so it has a greater performance impact. It's intended for debug use only. Use a
server based collector if performance is a concern.

### Trace context propagation

Gripmock recognises inbound trace contexts in w3c format and baggage format by
default. To use support zipkin B3 headers or other propagators, run gripmock
with the environment variable `OTEL_PROPAGATORS` set to
[any supported set of propagators](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/propagators/autoprop)
e.g.

    OTEL_PROPAGATORS=tracecontext,baggage,b3,b3multi gripmock ....

### Tracing demo

To test the tracing, you can set appropriate trace headers in 
[`grpcurl`](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) requests. For example, in
one session run `gripmock` to serve `example/simple/simple.proto`;
set the env-vars `OTEL_PROPAGATORS=tracecontext,baggage,b3,b3multi`
and `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=stdout`. Then in another session run:

    curl -X POST -d '{"service":"Gripmock","method":"SayHello","input":{"equals":{}},"output":{"data":{"message":"Hello GripMock"}}}' localhost:4771/add

   grpcurl -H 'b3: 80f198ee56343ba864fe8b2a57d3eff7-e457b5a2e4d86bd1-1' -plaintext localhost:4770 simple.Gripmock/SayHello
